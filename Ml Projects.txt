Ml Projects

- for creating any ML projects, you need to create an environment first
- all the packages installed will be available in the same folder as of the environment


--> syntax : ( conda create -p [env-name] python==3.8[python version we are using] -y[for approval])


#                                                                                                                                                                       
# To activate this environment, use                                                                                                                                     
#                                                                                                                                                                       
#     $ conda activate [env-name/]                                                                                                                                
#                                                                                                                                                                       
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate


If you're pushing to the github (git push -u origin main), then you've to set ""Git Global""
first check --> git config --global user.name ( if no response then write the next command)
git config --global user.name "Chandan Malakar"
then check --> git config --global user.email ( if no response then write the next command)
git config --global user.email "chandanmalakar6209@gmail.com"

then add a file from the github and name it (.gitignore) and set its language template to (Python)
it will remove all the files which are not committed


the setup.py is responsible for creating the ml application as a package
